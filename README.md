# Monolith to Microservice

## Prerequisites

You need **Docker** and **docker-compose** installed.

Everything is running in Docker container, so you don't need golang
either any other lib.

## Running

Just run

    make up

It will build Docker image and run monolith and microservices version.

### Services addresses

Monolith: http://localhost:8090/

---

Orders microservice: http://localhost:8070/

Shop microservice: http://localhost:8071/

Payments microservice: no public API (you can export ports in `docker-compose.yml` if you need)

For available methods, please check interfaces layer in source code and tests `tests/acceptance_test.go`.

## Running tests

First of all you must run services

    make up


Then you can run all tests by using in another terminal:

    make docker-test


If you want to test only monolith version:

    make docker-test-monolith

or microservices:

    make docker-test-microservices
